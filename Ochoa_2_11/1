Our project will have batteries around this time tommmorow.

The project doesn't require us to switch to PCB because we are programmming a drone.

Unfortunately, the code that we have prepared for the drone will not upload to our smart inventor board, this is the main obstacle 
that has been slowing our progress and will find a solution in the coming days.

There isn't much we could have done differently with the exception of the design of the controller.
